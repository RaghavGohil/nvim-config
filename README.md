# My nvim config
My neovim configuration. Learned from @theprimeagen!

# I am learning neovim?
By 11/27/2023, I am switching to neovim. I have been using vim from one year and I had set my eyes on neovim since.
Neovim is cool, fast, has a large community and has many MANY plugins on which people actively contribute to.
So far, it's been two days and I am absolutely loving it. It's damn fast ngl. Vim was fast w/ vim motions and it's plugins but this is awesome.
After watching @theprimeagen on YouTube, I am convinced that neovim is one of the best text editors on the planet. So, I will try and learn this and share and update my config here.

# This is what it looks like

cooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllll

# As of now my config consists of
- Treesitter
- Basic LSP
- TPope's vim fugitive
- Harpoon
- and a kanagawa theme

These aren't many as I am just starting out, but coming from vim, I am already feeling blazingly fast.
Also, I am using windows so I am trying to go for linux.
